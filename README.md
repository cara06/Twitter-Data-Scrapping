# Twitter-data-scrapping

This project illustrates how to scrape Twitter data based on certain hashtags using the python library, Tweepy.

The data targeted at here is based on the 2019 Nigerian general elections, which saw the use of many hashtags such as #NigeriaDecides, #Buhari, #Atiku etc

The datasets were collected through the Twitter API and stored in a csv file, which can be used for further analysis.
